            <p>Mahatma Gandhi, born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, India, is widely regarded as the Father of the Nation in India. His full name was Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, and he is celebrated for his steadfast commitment to nonviolent resistance and his pivotal role in leading India to independence from British rule. Gandhi's philosophy of nonviolent civil disobedience, known as Satyagraha, inspired countless movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. He emphasized the power of truth and the importance of ethical living, simplicity, and self-reliance. Through his leadership, Gandhi galvanized millions of Indians to participate in the struggle for freedom, advocating for economic self-sufficiency, the abolition of the caste system, and religious harmony. His legacy continues to inspire global movements for justice and peace.</p>
